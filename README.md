# Remi-s-Oblivion-Overhaul

This overhaul is a mix of various mods for Oblivion that do not initally go together. I have patched all of the conflicts using TES4edit and then patched the remaining landscape and entity issues with TES Construction Set in order to create the best Oblivion experience. This overhaul extends the length of the game by several hundreds of hours. Be careful in this version of Oblivion.

All Changes will be added to the read me soon.
